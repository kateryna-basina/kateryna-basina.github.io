        <h2><a name="top">European languages</a></h2>

<p><span class="bold">The European languages are members of the same family</span>. Their separate existence is a myth. <span class="italic">For science, music, sport, etc, Europe uses the same vocabulary</span>. The languages only differ in their grammar, their pronunciation and their most common words. Everyone realizes why a new common language would be desirable: one could refuse to pay expensive translators. To achieve this, it would be necessary to have uniform grammar, pronunciation and more common words. <br><br>

<span class="underline">If several languages coalesce</span>, the grammar of the resulting language is more simple and regular than that of the individual languages. <span class="strike">The new common language will be more simple and regular</span> than the existing European languages. It will be as simple as Occidental; in fact, it will be Occidental. To an English person, it will seem like simplified English, as a skeptical Cambridge friend of mine told me what Occidental is. The European languages are members of the same family. Their separate existence is a myth.<br><br>
